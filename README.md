# Toolkit
This toolkit provides general tools (classes, functions...) that are heavily used in
other projects. They are structured into different modules, depending on their purpose.

Feel free to propose adding  new tools via pull/merge requests.

## Currently present:
### MATLAB:
* Data analysis: Tools for data analysis.

* IO: Tools for inputting and outputting data into and from matlab.

* Mesh processing: Tools for working with meshes.

* ND image processing: Tools for processing with 2D, 3D,...,ND images.

* Visualiation: Tools for visualizing images and data.

* Windows: Windows specific tools.

* astra-1.8: The ASTRA Toolbox is a MATLAB and Python toolbox for high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography. See www.astra-toolbox.com for more information.

* geom3d: The aim of geom3d library is to handle and visualize 3D geometric primitives such as points, lines, planes, polyhedra... It provides low-level functions for manipulating 3D geometric primitives, making easier the development of more complex geometric algorithms. See https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24484-geom3d for more information.

## To be added:
* Modelling
* Python implementations
