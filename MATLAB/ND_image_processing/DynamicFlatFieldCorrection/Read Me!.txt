Dynamic flat field correction
------------------------------

Dynamic flat field correction was developed to deal with dynamic intensity changes 
of flat fields in x-ray imaging. More information about the algorithm can be found in the following publication:
V.Van Nieuwenhove, J. De Beenhouwer, F. De Carlo, L. Mancini, F. Marone, and J. Sijbers, 
"Dynamic intensity normalization using eigen flat fields in X-ray imaging", Optics Express, 2015

To use this Matlab implementation of the algorithm adapt the parameter section of the file 'DynamicFlatFieldCorrection.m'
to your needs and run it in Matlab.   

Requirements: 	BM3D filter (included), matlab(tested on matlab R2014b), 
				matlab Optimization Toolbox, matlab Image Processing Toolbox.
