<h2>astra-1.8 </h2>
The ASTRA Toolbox is a MATLAB and Python toolbox for high-performance GPU primitives for 2D and 3D tomography. See www.astra-toolbox.com for more information.
<h2>geom3d</h2>
The aim of geom3d library is to handle and visualize 3D geometric primitives such as points, lines, planes, polyhedra... It provides low-level functions for manipulating 3D geometric primitives, making easier the development of more complex geometric algorithms. See https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24484-geom3d for more information.
